## Overview

This project analyzes the historical data of the exchange rate between USD and KES from 2003 till today, we can build a predictive model to estimate the exchange rate in the future.
## Business Problem

A company based in Kenya imports raw materials from the United States and has been affected by the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the USD and KES. The company wants to forecast the exchange rate between USD and KES for the next few years to better plan their budget and manage their imports.

## Data

The Central bank of kenya is the regulatory authority responsible for issuing and regulating the KES currency. They also provide information on the USD/KES exchange rates and other financial data relevant to Kenya's economy. The data we are using on this project is available on their website.
The data files provide the daily exchange rate both buy and sell. 
"buy" refers to the rate at which commercial banks and other financial institutions are willing to buy US dollars in exchange for Kenyan shillings, while "sell" refers to the rate at which they are willing to sell US dollars to acquire Kenyan shillings.

## Methods

Our approach to building a predictive model will be to use a time series forecasting technique such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
